# Search-And-Find-in-Javascript
This is like a treasure hunt, or as I call it a search and find, in Javascript, no JQuery. Its theme is Star Wars called "Find Those Droids!" in which the player clicks somewhere, and the game responds to how close to the missing droids the player is.

I haven't tested this in any other browser but Chrome, but I will make it compatible with Firefox later. (It's an easy fix, but I will deal with it later when I get more time.)
